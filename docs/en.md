# Lubluelu SL68 (Tuya)

Control the Lubluelu SL68 robot vacuum — and other Tuya/Smart Life-based sweep robots — from
Gladys, directly over your local network. No custom hub, no keeping the phone app open.

## Overview

Day-to-day control (start/pause, mode, water level, suction, return to dock) goes straight to the
vacuum over the LAN, encrypted the same way the Smart Life/Tuya Smart app talks to it — no cloud
round-trip once everything is set up. Bootstrapping still needs to reach your Tuya account once,
for two things only:

- fetching the device's `local_key`, the encryption key local control requires (it is never
  broadcast on the LAN, only ever available behind your Tuya account);
- reading which features your specific vacuum actually has (start/pause, mode, water level,
  suction, battery...) — read from Tuya's own catalog for your device, not guessed.

Two ways to do that — pick whichever suits you, or set up both:

- **Smart Life account (recommended)** — no developer account, no Access ID/Secret to copy: scan
  a QR code with the app you already use for the vacuum, and every device on the account is
  discovered automatically, exactly like adding a device in the official app.
- **Tuya Cloud account (advanced)** — a free Tuya IoT Platform project, for people who already
  have one or want the explicit per-device control it gives.

The `local_key` **rotates** whenever the vacuum re-links to the cloud, so this integration
re-checks it periodically in the background (either method) — you never have to redo the setup
for that.

These features show up per vacuum, automatically adapted to what your specific device reports
(not every vacuum has every one of these). Their names are in French or English, as set by the
**Language of device names** field (Gladys keeps a name as it was when the device was added):

- **State** — what the robot is doing: cleaning, paused, returning to the dock, charging, on the
  dock, stopped, error. Gladys shows it as a badge, and it can start a scene ("when the vacuum is
  back on its dock").
- **Power** / **Pause** — start, stop or pause the current cleaning.
- **Mode** — a dropdown (Smart, Along walls, Spot, Selected rooms, Mopping, Return to dock...).
- **Return to dock** — a one-click button.
- **Water level** — mopping water flow, when your vacuum has a mop function.
- **Suction power** — when your vacuum reports a suction/power level.
- **Battery** — read-only, 0-100%.
- **Cleaned area / Cleaning time** — of the cleaning under way or last done, and their totals.
- **Fault code** — read-only, 0 normally.
- **Find robot** — makes the vacuum chirp, when supported.
- **Roll brush / Side brush / Filter / Mop pad** — remaining life, and a **Reset** button for
  each after you replace the part.
- **Do not disturb** — when your vacuum has a quiet-hours setting.
- **Zone - …** — one button per cleaning zone (see "Cleaning zones" below).

Requires **Gladys 5.1** or later.

## Dashboard widgets

Add them from the dashboard editor (**Add a widget**, then this integration). Each one shows the
vacuum picked in its settings, or the first one. They complement the core's **Devices** box,
which stays the place for every setting (dropdowns, switches):

- **Robot vacuum** — the robot at a glance: battery, state, program, suction, water, the area
  and time of the cleaning under way, a fault in red, local or cloud link; and the everyday keys
  of its remote: **Start** (or **Pause** / **Resume**, following the state), **Back to dock**,
  **Locate**, **Stop**.
- **Quick clean** — up to four one-tap cleanings, for a wall tablet. Each button is a program
  (_smart_, _edges_, _spot_, _mop_) or a zone name, typed in the widget settings. Left empty, it
  offers the vacuum's programs then its zones. The program under way is ticked.
- **Vacuum remote** — manual driving: forward, turn left, turn right, stop, with the state and
  battery. Only on vacuums that accept direction control; keep the robot in sight.
- **Vacuum maintenance** — the remaining life of each part as gauges, the most worn first, and a
  reset key (asking for confirmation) for each worn part once you have replaced it.

## Scenes

Triggers (**When…** in a scene):

- **Vacuum: cleaning finished** — the robot ended a cleaning and went back to its dock. Gives
  the cleaned area, the time and the battery to the next actions (for a message such as
  "Cleaning done: {{area_m2}} m² in {{duration_min}} min").
- **Vacuum: error** — the robot reported a fault (stuck, wheel, brush, dust bin...), with its
  description.
- **Vacuum: part worn out** — a part's remaining life dropped below 10%.

The robot's **State** is also a regular device state, usable as a trigger.

Actions (**Then…**):

- **Vacuum: start cleaning** — program, suction and water level applied together, then start:
  one card instead of three. _Unchanged_ keeps the robot's current setting.
- **Vacuum: clean a zone** — clean a zone by its name, as on the vacuum's zone buttons
  ("Zone - Kitchen" → `Kitchen`). Case and accents are ignored and a unique start is enough
  (`bed` for "Bedrooms"); when several zones start the same way, the scene log lists them.
  Gladys cannot show the zones in a drop-down here yet; the built-in **Control devices** action may
  offer the vacuum's "Zone - …" buttons in a list instead.

## Cleaning zones (LiDAR robots)

On robots that clean room by room (LiDAR robots with rooms in the Smart Life app), Gladys can
send the robot to clean one room, several rooms, or a zone drawn in the app:

1. **The easy way — memorize it from the app.** Start the room or zone clean once from the
   Smart Life app, while the integration is running. Then, in the integration's Configuration
   screen, run **Memorize the last zone**: pick the vacuum, give it a name ("Kitchen"). Gladys
   can now replay it any time.
2. **Or type the rooms by number**, in **Rooms by id (advanced)**: `Kitchen=2, Living room=0+1,
Bedrooms=3+4x2` (`+` for several rooms, `x2` for two passes). The room numbers are the
   robot's own: the integration logs them each time a room clean is started from the app.

Then open the **Discovery** tab and click **Update** on the vacuum: each zone gets its **Zone -
…** button, usable from the dashboard, the **Quick clean** widget and the **Vacuum: clean a
zone** scene action. **Forget a memorized zone** removes one. Re-mapping your home in the app
can renumber the rooms: memorize the zones again after a new map.

## Prerequisites

- The vacuum already set up and working in the **Smart Life** or **Tuya Smart** app.
- **"Local Network Discovery" (or similar) enabled** for the device in the Smart Life/Tuya Smart
  app (usually on by default) — some models only broadcast their LAN presence when this is on.

## Configuration — Smart Life account (recommended)

This integration's Configuration screen follows these steps top to bottom, numbered:

1. **1. Smart Life account**: open the app on your phone, go to **Me > Settings > Account and
   Security > User Code**, copy it, then paste it into the **Smart Life user code** field.
2. **2. Save**: click Save before continuing — the next step needs this code to already be
   saved, or it fails with an error.
3. **3. Connect and scan the QR code**: click this button, a QR code opens. In the Smart
   Life/Tuya Smart app, tap **+ > Scan**, point at the QR code, and tap **Confirm login**. The
   app may say the login is for "Home Assistant" — that's expected, this integration uses the
   same official Tuya mechanism Home Assistant's own integration does; only confirm if you just
   started this login yourself.
4. Open the **Discovery** tab and run a scan — every device on the account appears automatically,
   with the features each one actually supports. Add the ones you want.

That's it — pairing a new vacuum later is just: pair it in the Smart Life app, then Discovery >
Scan in Gladys. Nothing to configure per device.

## Configuration — Tuya Cloud account (advanced)

1. Go to [iot.tuya.com](https://iot.tuya.com/), create a **Cloud** project (the free "Smart Home"
   template is enough).
2. In the project's **Devices** tab, choose **Link Tuya App Account** and scan the QR code with
   the Smart Life/Tuya Smart app you use for the vacuum. Its devices then appear under **All
   Devices**.
3. Copy the project's **Access ID/Client ID** and **Access Secret/Client Secret** from the
   project's Overview tab into this integration's Configuration screen, along with the
   **Region** your project was created in (visible in the project URL: eu/us/cn/in).
4. Copy the vacuum's **Device ID** from the All Devices list into the **Device ID(s)** field
   (comma-separated if you have several).
5. Save, open the **Discovery** tab and run a scan, then add the device(s).

Both methods can run at once; a device id configured under the Tuya Cloud account takes priority
over the same device found via the Smart Life account.

A **Test connection** action is available from the Configuration screen for any added vacuum: it
reports whether the local session is up, and the vacuum's last known state (or its state read via
the cloud if the local session is currently down).

### If the vacuum's LAN IP isn't found automatically

Discovery relies on the vacuum announcing itself on the LAN (the same broadcast the phone app
uses to find it) — the Smart Life account method also reports the IP Tuya's servers have on file
for the device as a second source. If neither finds it (blocked broadcast between VLANs, some
mesh Wi-Fi setups...), fill in **Manual LAN IP(s) (advanced)**: `device_id=ip`, e.g.
`eb1234567890abcdef01=192.168.1.42`. A fixed IP or a DHCP reservation for the vacuum is
recommended in that case.

## Only one connection at a time

Like most Tuya local-control tools, only one client can hold the vacuum's local TCP session at
once. Keeping the Smart Life/Tuya Smart app open on the vacuum's device screen at the same time
this integration is connected can make both flaky — this is a limitation of the vacuum's own
firmware, not something this integration can work around.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No room or zone clean seen since the integration started"** when memorizing a zone: start
  the room/zone clean from the Smart Life app _after_ the integration started, wait a few
  seconds, then run the action again. If it still fails, your robot doesn't report its room
  selection: type the rooms by number instead.
- **A zone button does nothing**: the room numbers may have changed after a new map in the app —
  memorize the zone again.

- **"Enter your Smart Life user code first" even though it's filled in**: the form wasn't
  **saved** before clicking the connect button — those are two separate actions. Click Save, wait
  for the confirmation, then click **3. Connect and scan the QR code**. If the error persists,
  check the integration logs (`docker logs`): starting with 0.2.2, a failed attempt shows the
  exact detail there.
- **The QR code isn't confirmed / times out**: it expires in 1-2 minutes — reopen it (click
  Connect again) and scan promptly. If the app doesn't recognize it as valid, try switching
  **QR app (advanced)** between Smart Life and Tuya Smart in the Configuration screen and
  reconnecting.
- **Discovered but stuck "not connected"**: check the manual LAN IP fallback above, and make sure
  nothing else (the phone app, another automation tool) is holding the local session.
- **"Local session unreachable, falling back to the Tuya cloud API"** badge: the integration keeps
  working through cloud commands/status while it retries the local connection in the background —
  commands still work, just with more latency and a cloud round-trip until the LAN session
  recovers.
- **A feature you expect (e.g. Water level) is missing**: your vacuum's Tuya catalog entry may not
  report that code, or reports it under a name this integration doesn't yet recognize. Check the
  integration logs (`LOG_LEVEL=debug`) for the raw schema fetched from Tuya.
- The integration logs everything it does: check the integration logs from the Gladys UI (or
  `docker logs` on the host) with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for the full detail.
